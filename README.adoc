== Intro

Vim has syntax highlighting for asciidoc out of the box. And it is/was
really slow for me, probably because it tries to be very smart about syntax.

This plugin on the other hand has:

* quite limited syntax highlighting;
* sections folding;
* commands to build `HTML` (using `asciidoctor`), `PDF` (using `asciidoctor-pdf`) and `DOCX` (using combination of `asciidoctor` and `pandoc`)

And it is still way faster than built-in `syntax/asciidoc.vim`, for me.

== Installation

=== Vim8 built in packages

You can use git command on your command line:
[source,bash]
--------

git clone https://github.com/habamax/vim-asciidoctor.git ~/.vim/pack/my-packages/start/vim-asciidoctor

--------

For windows users you should change `~/.vim` to `%USERPROFILE%/vimfiles`
[source,cmd]
--------

git clone https://github.com/habamax/vim-asciidoctor.git %USERPROFILE%/vimfiles/pack/my-packages/start/vim-asciidoctor

--------

or `minpac` package manager (to add to your `.vimrc`):

[source,vim]
--------

call minpac#add('habamax/vim-asciidoctor')

--------

=== vim-plug

.Add to your .vimrc next to your other plugs
[source,vim]
--------

Plug 'habamax/vim-asciidoctor'

--------

== Setup
=== Vim
To use basic asciidoctor with vim you don't have to setup anything in vim. At
least this was the intention. :)

The following is an example setup. Part of it might not work for you if you don't have
asciidoctor extensions installed. Or you don't have custom PDF themes and fonts.

.asciidoctor
[source,vim]
--------

" What to use for HTML, default `asciidoctor`.
let g:asciidoctor_executable = 'asciidoctor'

" What extensions to use for HTML, default `[]`.
let g:asciidoctor_extensions = ['asciidoctor-diagram', 'asciidoctor-rouge']

" Path to the custom css
let g:asciidoctor_css_path = '~/docs/AsciiDocThemes'

" Custom css name to use instead of built-in
let g:asciidoctor_css = 'haba-asciidoctor.css'

--------

.asciidoctor-pdf
[source,vim]
--------

" What to use for PDF, default `asciidoctor-pdf`.
let g:asciidoctor_pdf_executable = 'asciidoctor-pdf'

" What extensions to use for PDF, default `[]`.
let g:asciidoctor_pdf_extensions = ['asciidoctor-diagram']

" Path to PDF themes, default `''`.
let g:asciidoctor_pdf_themes_path = '~/docs/AsciiDocThemes'

" Path to PDF fonts, default `''`.
let g:asciidoctor_pdf_fonts_path = '~/docs/AsciiDocThemes/fonts'

--------

.asciidoctor-docx
[source,vim]
--------

" What to use for DOCX, default `pandoc`.
" The DOCX 'compilation' process is to generate `docbook` using
" `g:asciidoctor-executable` and then to generate DOCX out of `docbook`
" using `pandoc`.
let g:asciidoctor_pandoc_executable = 'pandoc'

--------

.folding
[source,vim]
--------

" Fold sections, default `0`.
let g:asciidoctor_folding = 1

" Fold options, default `0`.
let g:asciidoctor_fold_options = 1

--------

.Syntax highlighting for other languages in [source] blocks
[source,vim]
--------

" List of filetypes to highlight, default `[]`
let g:asciidoctor_fenced_languages = ['python', 'c', 'javascript']

--------

.Syntax highlighting for plantuml blocks
[source,vim]
--------

" Make sure you have https://github.com/aklt/plantuml-syntax installed
let g:asciidoctor_highlight_plantuml = 1

--------

.default mappings... there are no default mappings
[source,vim]
--------

" Function to create buffer local mappings
fun! AsciidoctorMappings()
	nnoremap <buffer> <leader>oo :AsciidoctorOpenRAW<CR>
	nnoremap <buffer> <leader>op :AsciidoctorOpenPDF<CR>
	nnoremap <buffer> <leader>oh :AsciidoctorOpenHTML<CR>

	nnoremap <buffer> <leader>cp :Asciidoctor2PDF<CR>
	nnoremap <buffer> <leader>cx :Asciidoctor2DOCX<CR>
endfun

" Call AsciidoctorMappings for all `*.adoc` and `*.asciidoc` files
augroup asciidoctor
	au!
	au BufEnter *.adoc,*.asciidoc call AsciidoctorMappings()
augroup END

=== Asciidoctor
// TODO: setup asciidoctor <2018-09-20 11:09>

TODO: point to the asciidoctor installation manual?

== Commands

All commands are buffer local -- available only for asciidoctor files (`set filetype=asciidoctor`)

* `Asciidoctor2HTML` -- convert current file to `HTML`.
* `Asciidoctor2PDF` -- convert current file to `PDF`.
* `Asciidoctor2DOCX` -- convert current file to `DOCX`.
* `AsciidoctorOpenRAW` -- open current file in a browser. Chrome and Firefox has extentsions to render barebone `adoc` files.
* `AsciidoctorOpenPDF` -- open `PDF` of the current file using default PDF viewer.
* `AsciidoctorOpenHTML` -- open `HTML` of the current file using default web browser.
* `AsciidoctorOpenDOCX` -- open `DOCX` of the current file using default DOCX
  viewer. (I haven't tried it with LibreOffice or whatever else there might be.
  Also haven't tried it on linux and OSX...)

== Usage

1. Open `~/test.adoc`
2. Enter:
+
[literal]
.........

= Asciidoctor Title: Hanging around

This is the first para and it will be rendered with bigger text.

== Section 1

Text of section 1

== Section 2

Text of section 2

.........

3. Save it and export to `HTML`
+
[literal]
.........

:w<CR>
:Asciidoctor2HTML<CR>

.........

4. Open the `HTML` file:
+
[literal]
.........

:AsciidoctorOpenHTML<CR>

.........

=== HTML output
That should look something like this:

.HTML output
image::test_html.png[]

=== DOCX output
If you use `:Asciidoctor2DOCX` and `:AsciidoctorOpenDOCX` commands instead, you
should see something like this (provided you have `pandoc` and `MSWord`
installed:)

.DOCX output
image::test_docx.png[]

=== PDF output
And if you use `:Asciidoctor2PDF` and `:AsciidoctorOpenPDF` commands, you
should see something like this (I have my own default theme and fonts, so you
probably see it a bit different) :

.PDF title page output
image::test_pdf1.png[]

.PDF first page output
image::test_pdf2.png[]

// add some short youtube videos

== Paste images from clipboard

Vim can't access graphical part of clipboard thus an external tool should be used to save clipboard image to a png file.

* For Windows I use GraphicsMagic (could be installed using `scoop`)
* For OSX I use `pngpaste` (could be installed using `brew`)
* For Linux -- you tell me what to use :)

image::https://github.com/habamax/habamax.github.io/blob/master/assets/gifs/asciidoctor-pasteimg.gif[animated screen with image pasting]

.setup
[source,vim]
--------
" first `%s` is a path
" second `%s` is an image file name
" this is default for windows
" for osx it is `pngpaste %s%s`
let g:asciidoctor_img_paste_command = 'gm convert clipboard: %s%s'


" first `%s` is a base document name:
" (~/docs/hello-world.adoc => hello-world)
" second `%s` is a number of the image.
let g:asciidoctor_img_paste_pattern = 'img_%s_%s.png'
--------

If there is `:imagesdir:` as an option set up in a document, clipboard image
is saved there (relative to the document). Otherwise image is saved in the documents directory.

The name of the image is generated according to the pattern. By default it is

 img_ + document_base_name + next_image_number + .png

== Limitations

=== No highlighting for underlined headers

----
 This Header level 1 is not highlighted
 ======================================

 This Header level 2 is not highlighted
 --------------------------------------

----

It is not a big deal to hightlight them and in fact they were highlighed at
some point but then it clashed badly with all different blocks asciidoctor
has:
