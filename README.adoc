== What about built-in asciidoc support?

Vim has only syntax highlighting for asciidoc out of the box. And it is/was
really slow for me, probably because it tries to be very smart about syntax.

This plugin on the other hand supports:

* quite limited syntax highlighting;
* sections folding;
* commands to build html (using asciidoctor), pdf (using asciidoctor-pdf) and docx (using combination of asciidoctor and pandoc)
